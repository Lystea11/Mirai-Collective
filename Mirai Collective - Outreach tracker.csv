Mosiac Center,"Texas, USA",https://www.mosaiccenter.org/,"Dear Mosaic Center Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Lysandre, and on behalf of a group of students at The American School in Japan (ASIJ) in Tokyo, I would like to express our deep admiration for the work of The Mosaic Center.

We have been inspired by your faith‑based mission to “Educate, Elevate, and Activate women” by guiding them toward economic self‑sufficiency through programs such as the 12‑week Job & Life Skills Core Program, GED and ESL coursework, resume writing, mock interviews, budgeting and parenting training, all offered in a nurturing Christian environment that embodies “a hand up, not a handout”.

We were particularly impressed by your 20-year legacy of transforming lives, now approaching your 40th graduating class, and the testimonials highlighting how your graduates have gained confidence and employment success as a direct result of the center’s programs.

Over the past several weeks, our student group has been studying models of community empowerment and women’s economic development. We believe that Japan, while culturally different, faces many comparable challenges around empowering women who are striving for stability and independence. With that in mind, we are exploring the possibility of adapting elements of The Mosaic Center’s Core Program for women in Japan, in partnership with local community centers, schools, or faith-based organizations.

We would be honored to learn more about your journey, program structure, and lessons learned in establishing and sustaining your work. Specifically, we would be interested in discussing: Curriculum structure--how you organize operations like your two annual 12-week cohorts, key modules like Jobs for Life, life skills, parenting, budgeting, and certification prep. Along with insights on your: Volunteer and mentoring model--how you recruit, train, and engage your volunteer base and staff. Finally, to know your adaptation strategy--what advice you might offer for adapting your Core Program model to a different cultural context, such as Japan, where the language, systems, and social norms differ.

While we are still in the planning and research phase, our hope is that this initial outreach could open the door to a cross‑cultural exchange or pilot collaboration. We would be grateful for any guidance, resources, or even brief conversations you are able to offer.

Thank you for taking the time to read this message and for your inspiring example of community service that reaches globally. We truly believe that empowering women through education, faith, and practical skills is a universal mission.

If possible, we would love the opportunity for a short virtual conversation at your convenience. Please let us know if there is a staff member or volunteer whom you recommend we contact.

Thank you again, and may The Mosaic Center continue to impact many more lives.

Warm regards,

Greater Waukegan Development Coalition,USA,https://greaterwaukegan.org/,"Dear Greater Waukegan Development Coalition Team,

I hope you are well. My name is Lysandre, and I am writing on behalf of a group of students at The American School in Japan (ASIJ) in Tokyo. We have been deeply inspired by the mission and success of the Greater Waukegan Development Coalition (GWDC) in fostering holistic community and economic development in Greater Waukegan, Illinois.

Your comprehensive approach to support entrepreneurship, transform real estate development, increase access to capital, and create community-centered programming demonstrates a clear and effective strategy for revitalizing a metropolitan area facing socioeconomic challenges. We were particularly impressed by your flagship ""Lake County Tech Hub"", which provides mentorship, training, and resources to aspiring entrepreneurs and small business owners; GWDC Invests, facilitating access to funding; and SelectChicago, which promotes foreign direct investment to grow the local economy in collaboration with diverse stakeholders.

We note that GWDC operates with a dedicated team of about 11–50 staff members, and maintains an active presence with approximately 1,000 LinkedIn followers. Your organizational scale allows you to deliver impactful programs, including the Community Contracting Project, Hub Studios, and multicultural festivals, that engage residents and strengthen local capacity.

At ASIJ, our student group has been exploring scalable community development models that empower individuals and local economies. We believe that Japan, while economically advanced, still faces challenges in connecting underserved neighborhoods to entrepreneurship resources, community programming, and revitalizing civic engagement. Inspired by GWDC’s approach, we are interested in adapting elements of your model--such as entrepreneurial mentorship, community festivals, and inclusive real estate or contracting initiative--to the Japanese world.

We would be honored to learn more about your journey, program execution, and key lessons. Specifically, we are interested in discussing: program design and impact--how GWDC integrates initiatives like the Tech Hub, SelectChicago, and community contracting to create synergy across programs. As well as community engagement strategy--how you build trust and participation in multicultural and economically diverse communities through events (such as Lake County Fiestas) and local contracting projects. Finally, adaptation advice, what guidance you might offer in forming a pilot program in Japan that reflects the collaborative, multi-stakeholder model you’ve developed.

While we are still in the exploratory phase, we hope that this outreach may lead to mentorship opportunities, virtual exchanges, or resource-sharing collaborations. Your work’s focus on systemic change through integrated development deeply resonates with our goals.

If possible, we would greatly appreciate any guidance you can share or the opportunity for a brief virtual meeting or call at your convenience. Please feel free to direct us to a staff member or volunteer with whom we might connect.

Thank you very much for your time and for the impactful work you are doing in Waukegan. We believe that replicating your community-strengthening models in new contexts can foster inclusive development across borders.

We’re reaching out to explore the possibility of a collaboration to extend your impact to Japan, through student-led initiatives modeled after your incredible work. We’d love to pilot awareness efforts similar to #HelloYellow, translate/adapt some of your youth-facing resources, and engage with other international schools to spark a regional movement for change.

We admire your work in mobilizing young voices, especially through campaigns like Beyond Tomorrow, and we would be honored to work with YoungMinds to help bring your mission and message to students here in Japan.
